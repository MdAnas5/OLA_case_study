# 🚗 OLA Driver Churn - Case Study

This project analyzes driver attrition (churn) at Ola using data-driven insights and ensemble machine learning methods.

### 📘 Files Included
- **OLA_case_study_updated.ipynb** — Full analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (Bagging & Boosting).
- **driver_churn_scores_with_band.csv** — Predicted churn probabilities for each driver.
- **model_summary.txt** — Key model metrics and summary.

### 🧠 Highlights
- Used **KNN Imputation**, **SMOTE**, and **Ensemble Learning** for robust churn prediction.  
- Features like `income_increase`, `rating_increase`, and `tenure` strongly influence driver retention.  
- Achieved high ROC-AUC using XGBoost model.

### 💡 Recommendations
1. Incentivize drivers showing income decline.  
2. Mentor and retain new drivers within first 90 days.  
3. Focus retention campaigns on cities with high churn.  
4. Monitor churn probabilities monthly.  
5. Use dashboard insights for targeted engagement.
